# Clean-Mini-Map
What does Clean-Mini-Map do?<br>
Cleans the area around wows mini-map to get rid of the annoying buttons<br>
and neatly consolidates them in a strip, and removes the round border from<br> 
the mini-map and and a few other tweaks.<br>

Will more be added in time?<br>
The Addon will grow with time, this is just the initial part of the development.<br>

Is anything customizable with the locations of the frames?<br>
Not at present this is something I will be looking at implementing shortly with a settings screen.<br>

Notes: Not compatible with SexyMap or other map addons, no plans to change this in the near future.
