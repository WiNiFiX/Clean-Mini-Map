# Clean-Mini-Map
What does Clean-Mini-Map do?
Cleans the area around wows mini-map to get rid of the annoying buttons and neatly consolidates them in a strip,

and removes the round border from the mini-map and and a few other tweaks.

Will more be added in time?
The Addon will grow with time, this is just the initial part of the development.

Is anything customizable with the locations of the frames?
Not at present this is something I will be looking at implementing shortly with a settings screen.

Notes: Not compatible with SexyMap or other map addons, no plans to change this in the near future.
